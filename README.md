# 🎯 R6 No Recoil

![Preview](website/static/image.png)

A lightweight, efficient **no-recoil tool** for Rainbow Six Siege. Designed for smooth performance and ease of use.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Most recoil tools like Logitech G Hub are bloated, heavy, and come with a ton of unnecessary overhead just to perform a simple task. I built this tool to be **clean**, **compact**, and **laser-focused** on one thing: **removing recoil with minimal system impact**. No drivers, no background bloat—just raw utility.

## 🚀 Why Use This Tool?

- **📌 No Recoil** – Reduces weapon recoil for better accuracy.
- **⚡ Lightweight & Fast** – Optimised for minimal CPU usage.
- **🔧 No Installation Required** – Just run the `.exe`.
- **🖥️ Works on Any Setup** – Supports Windows 10/11.
- **🛠️ Open Source & Customisable** – Modify as needed.

## 🎮 How to Use
1. **Download** `r6-no-recoil.exe` from the Github Release Page.
2. **Run the Program** (double-click `r6-no-recoil.exe`).
3. **Controls:**
   - **Press `Enter`** → Toggle the no-recoil effect on/off.
   - **Scroll Mouse Up/Down** → Adjust recoil compensation speed.
4. **Enjoy Smoother Aim!**

## 🚧 Currently in Development
- **Crouch Macro** – As suggested by [r6cruch](https://github.com/Harry-Hopkinson/R6-No-Recoil/issues/1)
- **Improved GUI** – A cleaner, more user-friendly interface is being developed.
- **Customisation Options** – Ability to fine-tune settings via a UI panel.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Use it at your own risk. I do not advocate cheating.
Windows Defender may falsely flag this program as a virus. Just allow the app to run anyway. If you are unsure, use **VirusTotal** to check the program.
