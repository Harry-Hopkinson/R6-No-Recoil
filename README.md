A lightweight, efficient **no-recoil tool** for Rainbow Six Siege. Designed for smooth performance and ease of use.

## üß† Why I Made This

Most recoil tools like Logitech G Hub (now detectable) are bloated, heavy, and come with a ton of unnecessary overhead just to perform a simple task. I built this tool to be **clean**, **compact**, and **laser-focused** on one thing: **removing recoil with minimal system impact**. No drivers, no background bloat‚Äîjust raw utility.

## üöÄ Why Use This Tool?

- **üìå No Recoil** ‚Äì Reduces weapon recoil for better accuracy.
- **‚ö° Lightweight & Fast** ‚Äì Optimised for minimal CPU usage.
- **üîß No Installation Required** ‚Äì Just run the `.exe`.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Powerful Config Support** ‚Äì Modify the Config.toml file.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Works on Any Setup** ‚Äì Supports Windows 10/11.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Open Source & Customisable** ‚Äì Modify as needed.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Download** `R6NoRecoil` from the [Github Release Page](https://github.com/Harry-Hopkinson/R6-No-Recoil/releases/latest).
2. **Run the Program** (double-click `R6NoRecoil.exe`).
3. **Choose whether attacking or defending**.
4. **Choose your operator and their primary weapon**.
5. **Controls:**
   - **Press `Toggle Recoil`** ‚Üí Toggle the no-recoil effect on/off.
   - **Press `Change Mode`** ‚Üí Adjust the strength of the recoil compensation.
   - **Press `Toggle Key`** -> Enable/Disable toggle key activating/deactivating recoil. Default CapsLock.
   - **Switch to Defenders/Attackers** -> Change operator type.
6. **Enjoy Smoother Aim!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Setup Note

To ensure the recoil compensation behaves consistently across all systems, you must:

1. **Disable Windows mouse acceleration** (Enhance Pointer Precision).
2. **Enable raw mouse input in Rainbow Six Siege**.

### üîß How to disable **Enhance Pointer Precision**

#### Method 1: Using Control Panel
1. **Open the Control Panel.**
   - Press **Windows + R**, type `control`, and press **Enter**.

2. **Go to Mouse ‚Üí Pointer Options.**
   - In Control Panel, set **View by** to **Large icons** or **Small icons**.
   - Click **Mouse**.
   - Select the **Pointer Options** tab.

3. **Uncheck the box for "Enhance pointer precision".**

4. **Click Apply and OK.**

#### Method 2: Using Windows Settings
1. **Open Settings.**
   - Press **Windows + I** to open the Settings app.

2. **Go to Devices ‚Üí Mouse.**
   - In the left sidebar, select **Mouse**.
   - Click **Additional mouse options** on the right.

3. **Disable Enhance pointer precision.**
   - In the **Pointer Options** tab, uncheck **Enhance pointer precision**.

4. **Click Apply and OK.**

### üéØ How to Enable Raw Mouse Input in Rainbow Six Siege

1. **Close Rainbow Six Siege** completely.
2. **Locate your GameSettings.ini file**:
    ```plaintext
    Documents\My Games\Rainbow Six - Siege\<RandomNumbersFolder>\GameSettings.ini
    ```
3. **Open the file in Notepad (or any text editor)**.
4. **Find the line**:
    ```plaintext
    RawInputMouseKeyboard=0
    ```
5. **Change it to**:
    ```plaintext
    RawInputMouseKeyboard=1
    ```
6. **Save the file and close the editor**.
7. **Restart the game** ‚Äî raw mouse input will now be active.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config Explained

The app automatically creates a `Config.toml` file on first run. You can manually edit it to customise the experience.

### Example:

```toml
[RecoilPresets]
VerticalRecoil = 3
HorizontalRecoil = 0
Enabled = true

# Use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
# And then convert the key code to decimal
# Toggle Key (e.g. 20 = CAPS LOCK)
ToggleKey = 20
```

## üî´ WeaponData.json Explained

The app uses a `WeaponData.json` file to store **recoil compensation values** for each weapon. This allows you to fine-tune how much recoil reduction is applied for every primary gun in Rainbow Six Siege.

### Example Structure

```json
{
    "name": "R4-C",
    "recoil": {
        "non_magnified": { "vertical": 3, "horizontal": 0 },
        "magnified": { "vertical": 6, "horizontal": 0 }
    }
},
```

### Fields Explained

- **name:** The exact name of the weapon as recognised by the app.
- **non_magnified and magnified** Specifies whether recoil is for Non-Magnified and Magnified scopes respectively.
- **vertical:** The amount of vertical recoil compensation applied.
  - **Higher values = stronger recoil reduction**
  - **Lower values = lighter recoil reduction**
  - **Typical range:** 1 (low recoil SMGs) to 6 (high recoil assault rifles), but you can experiment.
- **horizontal:** The amount of horizontal recoil compensation applied.
  - **Typical range:** Between 1 and 2.
