A lightweight, efficient **no-recoil tool** for Rainbow Six Siege. Designed for smooth performance and ease of use.

## üß† Why I Made This

Most recoil tools like Logitech G Hub (now detectable) are bloated, heavy, and come with a ton of unnecessary overhead just to perform a simple task. I built this tool to be **clean**, **compact**, and **laser-focused** on one thing: **removing recoil with minimal system impact**. No drivers, no background bloat‚Äîjust raw utility.

## üöÄ Why Use This Tool?

- **üìå No Recoil** ‚Äì Reduces weapon recoil for better accuracy.
- **‚ö° Lightweight & Fast** ‚Äì Optimised for minimal CPU usage.
- **üîß No Installation Required** ‚Äì Just run the `.exe`.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Powerful Config Support** ‚Äì Modify the Config.toml/WeaponData.json files.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Highly Customisable** ‚Äì Save weapon data to presets for quick switching.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Works on Any Setup** ‚Äì Supports Windows 10/11.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Download** `R6NoRecoil` from the [Github Release Page](https://github.com/Harry-Hopkinson/R6-No-Recoil/releases/latest).
2. **Run the Program** (double-click `R6NoRecoil.exe`).
3. **Choose whether attacking or defending**.
4. **Choose your operator and their primary weapon**.
5. **Choose your weapon preset**.
6. **Controls:**
    - **Press `Toggle Recoil`** ‚Üí Toggle the no-recoil effect on/off.
    - **Press `Change Mode`** ‚Üí Adjust the strength of the recoil compensation.
    - **Press `Toggle Key`** -> Enable/Disable toggle key activating/deactivating recoil. Default CapsLock.
    - **Press `Save Config`** -> Save current weapon data to the selected preset.
    - **Switch to Defenders/Attackers** -> Change operator type.
7. **Enjoy Smoother Aim!**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config Explained

The app automatically creates a `Config.toml` file on first run. You can manually edit it to customise the experience.

### Example:

```toml
[RecoilPresets]
Enabled = true
VerticalRecoil = 3
HorizontalRecoil = 0

[Controller]
Enabled = false
Multiplier = 10

[ToggleKey]
# Use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
# And then convert the key code to decimal
# Toggle Key (e.g. 20 = CAPS LOCK)
ToggleKey = 20
Enabled = false
```

### Fields Explained

#### [RecoilPresets]

- **Enabled:** Enable or disable recoil adjustment.
- **VerticalRecoil:** The vertical recoil compensation value.
- **HorizontalRecoil:** The horizontal recoil compensation value (Positive goes right, negative goes left)

#### [Controller]

- **Enabled:** Enable or disable recoil adjustment with a controller.
- **Multiplier:** The multiplier for controller adjustment when firing.

#### [ToggleKey]

- **ToggleKey:** The key code for toggling recoil adjustment.
- **Enabled:** Enable or disable recoil adjustment with a toggle key.

## üî´ WeaponData.json Explained

The app uses a `WeaponData.json` file to store **recoil compensation values** for each weapon. This allows you to fine-tune how much recoil reduction is applied for every primary gun in Rainbow Six Siege.

### Example Structure

```json
{
    "name": "R4-C",
    "preset-1": { "vertical": 7.5, "horizontal": 0 },
    "preset-2": { "vertical": 3.0, "horizontal": 0 },
    "preset-3": { "vertical": 0.0, "horizontal": 0 }
},
```

### Fields Explained

- **name:** The exact name of the weapon as recognised by the app.
- **preset-1/2/3** Specifies which preset to use for the weapon.
- **vertical:** The amount of vertical recoil compensation applied.
    - **Higher values (Vertical) = stronger recoil reduction**
    - **Lower values (Vertical) = lighter recoil reduction**
- **horizontal:** The amount of horizontal recoil compensation applied.
    - **Positive Values (Horizontal) = movement to the right**
    - **Negative Values (Horizontal) = movement to the left**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Use it at your own risk. I do not advocate cheating.
Windows Defender may falsely flag this program as a virus. Just allow the app to run anyway. If you are unsure, use **VirusTotal** to check the program.
